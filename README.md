### Python Bike Share Analysis

### Date created
This project and its associated README file were first created on this forked repository on 21 May 2019.

### Description
Python is used to explore bike share usage data for the cities of Chicago, New York City and Washington. User inputs are used to calculate various overview statistics:
    - the highest frequency month, day of the week and hour during which journeys began
    - the most common start station, end station and trip combination
    - the total and average travel time
    - counts of each user type (all cities) and counts of gender and birth metrics (for New York City and Chicago only)
